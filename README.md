# Flexbox Edge Ledger Project

This project will use Flexbox to create a responsive website.

## About

This project was completed through a Udemy class by Traversy Media. My challenge during this project was to complete the majority of the project mobile-first, instead of desktop-first, as it was taught in the course. This was intended as a way of practicing mobile-first design.
